# Appraising Hammer Indicator Behavior Between 2019-2021


### About this Project

An aspect of my life I want to improve at is being able to trade effectively in the stock market, and as a result, I came up with this project to assess the capabilities of the hammer indicator. The hammer is a technical indicator that is not intended to be traded alone, but the presence of one can influence a trader to make an informed trading decision. Being that it is a technical indicator, it's expected to appear in charts without discerning the fundamentals or shape of the chart. I started with python and pandas to collect hammer data in the Nasdaq 100 between the years of 2019 to 2021, and then used Tableau to aid in visualizations.
